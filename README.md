# About Me

This is the repo we used to learn (mostly) python. Looking back at these projects it's hard to believe the progress I've made on my coding journey. Before these 19 project and the three months I spent on them, all I knew was C, and before that I had zero coding experience. Pretty crazy how far I've come during my time at Holberton. At first I didn't like Python, I thought it was too "loosey-goosey" compared to the rigidness of C. I also had a great deal of trouble wrapping my head around classes initially. Funny to think that something so simple gave me so much trouble, but it's again just a testament to how much I have improved my skills. Nowadays I feel like I could make anything in Python thanks to its abundance of powerful libraries and ease of use.

# Project descriptions

### 0x00-python-hello_world

This was, as the name suggests, just a basic intro to python: print formatting, if/else statements, and loops. Nothing too crazy.

### 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions

Once again we have a descriptive name. In this project we dove a little deeper into both if/else statements and loops. We also learned how to implement functions.

### 0x01-python-import_modules

Not too crazy here, just learned how to import modules. Pretty self-explanatory :P

### 0x02-python-data_structures

For this project we learned about lists and tuples. I wouldn't learn until much later how much I loved lists and how they can be used for almost anything. I was stuck in the C mindset. "Waaah I want arrays T_T". What a fool I was...

### 0x03-python-more_data_structures

The focus of this project was on sets and dictionaries. We also touched on map and lambda functions (yuck!).

### 0x04-python-classes

This was our introduction to python classes and objects. Like I touched on earlier in my about me, it's pretty nostalgic at this point to think about how such a simple concept gave me so much trouble at the time. How cute haha. The end goal of this project was to make a square of #'s using a Square class.

### 0x06-python-more_classes

More classes and objects! We built on the last project, this time using a Rectangle class. The big new concept for this project were class functions!

### 0x07-python-test_driven_development

The coding problems were simple for this project, because the focus was on... TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT YAAAAY.

### 0x0A-python-inheritance

Learned how to inherit attributes from another class.

### 0x0B-python-object_relational_mapping

For this project we used mySQLbd and SQLAlchemy to use python to manipulate SQL databases. I loved this project, easily one of my favorites of the python curriculum.

### 0x0C-python-almost_a_circle

This was a review project for all of the techniques we had learned so far in python.

### 0x0C-python-network_1

For this project we used the urllib and requests python packages to make GET, POST, PUT requests to a server. Our first taste of the world of API's.

### 0x00-javascript-warm_up

Familiarized ourselves with the basics of javascript.

### 0x01-javascript_objects_scopes_closures

Step-by-step implementaion of a class in javascript

### 0x02-javascript-web_scraping

Used the request module to interact with API's

### 0x03-javascript-web_jquery

Intro to jquery.

### 0x00-SQL_introduction

Our first foray into SQL. We familiarized ourselves with the basic keywords or SQL while also hosting our own database.

### 0x01-SQL_more_queries

Learned how to create new users and manage their privileges, new keywords, and more advanced queries.
